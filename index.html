                    <h1>Dhruv Sunil Desai</h1>
                    <p>HI, it's my pleasure to have you here! Just a quick intro - I am a web developer currently working at Colfax International. The stream of computers and especially web development has always excited me. This journey began with an introductory course in high school which introduced me to the world of HTML. It felt as if it had paved a way for me to express my creativity through design. It gave me a hint and a confidence that a lot of time taking or mundane task can be made much simpler. This inspired me to pursue my Bachelor's in Information Technology from Mumbai University and Master's in Computer Science from California State University of Long Beach.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this journey, I have had many good friends who inspired me to keep on going and I am really indebted to them. One such example is of Harbir and Sambhav who introduced me to ReactJS while we were working on accademic project in Semantic UI. ReactJS has been my favourite library since then and though it was never part of my imagination, its been 3 years working in the industry using this library, it still facinates me. Along with React, I have also worked with NodeJS and Express to create backend service using MySQL database in Agile/Scrum environment and Redux for state management. To ensure code's quality and avoid bugs we use Jest, Enzyme and React Testing Library for testing.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to find more info about me down below and leave me a message. Links to my resume, linkedin profile and email are onto your right.</p>
